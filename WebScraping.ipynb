We've built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics. It’s a product that clinicians need and love.<p>We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing care.<p>It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections). We track money movement on a unified ledger and reconcile transactions with clinics' bank accounts.<p>There is so much more to build. If you're interested in scaling data pipelines, programmable rules engines, AI, data science, delightful products for small clinics, processing billions of dollars in money movementm or solving the unsexy problems that make this country's healthcare broken, come join us!<p>We are a team of ~40 with strong product market fit. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work delivering care for kids.<p>Email us at josh.paul@juniperplatform.com or apply at jobs.lever.co/juniperplatform</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n",

We have many ideas that want to be implemented by you.<p>Who you are: You’re comfortable with coding. You know modern C++. You likely spent 5+ years as a (hobby?) programmer and have made a lot of mistakes and learned from those. You survived nights in front of the holy Visual Studio debugger on Windows. You used Git and merge workflows. You were annoyed by linker errors and had victories over clang or MSVC. You know what a mutex is and think in terms of CPU slices. You favor native over Electron. You secretly dream at night to have hair like Bjarne.<p>What you maybe did: You’ve built your own home automation? Your own game? Your own container implementation? Your own CI? Your own OS? Your own programming language? We want you!<p>What you will be doing: You will implement code according to specification (you can influence those of course), work on our backlog and go on bug hunting sessions with a debugger. You will be working together with us and will not shy away from asking us questions proactively by talking/writing in fluent English. You will be enjoying cheat vendors catching up to us and playing the cat and mouse game with them.<p>What we offer: Small dedicated remote-first and open-minded team. Well-architectured code base originated in 2022 using C++23. Your code will partially run in Windows kernel mode. We don’t have scheduled meetings. We <i>talk</i> on the spot and are always available for help. We don’t care about your working hours if you are available during UTC+2 in the warmup period of some months.<p>Ready for a short interview process? Talk directly to our team.

We are hiring for several roles, but the ones I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer and Infrastructure Software Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).\n",
            "    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.\n",
            "    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.\n",
            "    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.\n",

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.<p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.<p>--<p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.<p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.<p>--<p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.<p>Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.<p>--<p>Ex-Founders (all roles) - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We encourage founders in software engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, design, and product to reach out. If you don't see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com. We care more about the person than the job position, and we're happy to craft the perfect position for anyone that joins our team. People with founder experience tend to be very successful at MixRank, and our leadership team is filled with founders.<p>--<p>Applicants from Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa are especially encouraged.<p>I'm Scott, Founder/CEO/CTO.
